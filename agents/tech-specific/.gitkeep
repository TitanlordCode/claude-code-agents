# Tech-Specific Agent Knowledge

This directory is auto-populated by agents as they learn your project patterns.

When you run `/review`, `/test`, or `/pre-commit` for the first time, the agent will:
1. Detect your language and framework
2. Create a tech-specific knowledge file (e.g., `review-javascript-vue.md`)
3. Use this file in future runs for faster, more consistent results

You can:
- Manually edit these files to add team conventions
- Commit them to share knowledge across your team
- Keep them local for personal customization
